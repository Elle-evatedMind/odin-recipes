        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>If you don't know what a cookie is, you are either an archeologist or historian from after World War III, or you are an alien.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups salted butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li>4 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>340 grams milk chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>flour, baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch, 
                    and kosher salt in a large bowl and whisk until 
                    well incorporated; set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Add butter, brown sugar, and white sugar to a bowl. 
                    Mix with an electric whisk on medium speed until light
                    and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add in eggs one at a time,
                    until just combined. Add in vanilla; gradually add in
                    dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips.
                </li>
                <li>Using a 1/2 cup measure, scoop balls of dough into hands
                    and form into a loose ball. Place cookie dough balls on a 
                    rimmed baking sheet and place in refrigerator for about 1 
                    hour or until ready to bake. Alternatively, place in the freezer 
                    for 25 to 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees celcius. Line baking sheets with parchment. 
                    Working in batches of 3 or 4 cookies per baking sheet, carefully tear each 
                    dough ball in half and place one half on top of the other with the broken, 
                    jagged side up. Gently press the 2 halves together, taking care not to smooth 
                    the top. Place cookies on the prepared baking sheet, leaving plenty of space between cookies.
                </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden around the edges and barely set in the middle, 
                    10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool completely on the baking sheet.
                </li>
            </ol>
